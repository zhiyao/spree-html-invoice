SUMMARY
=======

This extension provides a "Print Invoice" button on the Admin Orders view screen which opens a printable html page with the order details.

You have to set up your computer for printing, or PDF generation. Off course, if you cave a mac that is as easy as pressing the print + save as pdf buttons.

If you need server-side pdf generation, use the spree-print-invoice extension.
 
INSTALLATION
============

For spree 1.0, There is a tag for 0.7.

As I don't release gems, for better version control you may wish to clone the repository. 
If you have improvements, please send pull though.

1. To install you need to add the following lines to your Gemfile (no external dependencies)

    gem 'spree_html_invoice' , :git => 'git://github.com/dancinglightning/spree-html-invoice.git'

2. run bundler

    bundle install

3. Configure your logo and footer text or more. It's easy as it's html.

4. Enjoy!


Configuration
==============

1. Set the logo path preference to include your store / company logo.

    Spree::HtmlInvoice::Config.set(:html_invoice_logo_path => "company-logo.png")
    
    Somewhere in your asset path

2. Override any of the partial templates. they are address, footer, totals, header, thanks , and the line_items. The whole tanks is wrapped in a thanks hook, so replace or add at will.

3. Set Spree::HtmlInvoice::Config.set(:suppress_anonymous_address) option to get blank addresses for anonymous email addresses (as created by my spree_last_address extension for empty/unknown user info)

4. Enable packaging slips, by setting 

  Spree::HtmlInvoice::Config.set(:print_buttons => "invoice,packaging_slip")  #comma separated list

  Use above feature for your own template if you want. For each button_name, define a subsection with header,   print, and thanks, in your locale.


Extra
=====

There is now a receipt template, for a normal receipt printer (ie 70mm). This works for us, but what about you?

Barcodes have gone to their own package spree-product-barcodes

Contributions welcome
